Overview
========

Placement Hints is an implementation of the algorithm for picking morphologies for given cell positions, which aims to match a set of constraints prescribed by *placement rules*.

===============

Placement Hints is a generalization of the approach originally proposed by `Michael Reimann <mailto:michael.reimann@epfl.ch>`_ and `Eilif Muller <mailto:eilif.mueller@epfl.ch>`_ for hexagonal mosaic circuits.

The development of this software was supported by funding to the Blue Brain Project, a research center of the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), from the Swiss government’s ETH Board of the Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology.
